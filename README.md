# trayio
open tray page, Create workflow, Delete workflow and exit

This code is used for implementing

1. Login into tray.io with a pre-defined login/password.
2. Create a workflow. Bydefault, a workflow is created with name "testing" but can be replaced by any other name.
3. Check if workflow is created by going to home page.
4. Delete the workflow.


Testing

Tested with :

1. OS - Fedora release 22 (Twenty Two).
2. Firefox version - Mozilla Firefox 40.0.3.
3. Selenium - selenium-webdriver@2.46.0.
4. Nodejs Version - 10.10.0.

Running Script:

/usr/local/n/versions/node/10.10.0/bin/node logintray.js

How it works
